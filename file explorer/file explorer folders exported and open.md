# Windows Explorer Session Manager
**A PowerShell-based Toolbox for Exporting and Restoring Folder Workflows.**

## Project Overview
This project consists of two companion PowerShell scripts designed to capture and restore active Windows Explorer sessions. By utilizing the Windows Shell COM object, these scripts identify all open folder paths and store them in a structured format (CSV or TXT), allowing for seamless workflow transitions between different workstations, reboots, or project phases.

## 🛠 Script 1: Explorer Path Exporter
The Exporter script identifies every active File Explorer window and captures its local directory path.

### Key Features
* **Dual Logic Modes:** Choose between a detailed COM object retrieval or a streamlined single-line execution.
* **Instant Keypress UI:** Uses `ReadKey` for immediate navigation—no need to press "Enter" for Yes/No prompts.
* **Chronological Naming:** Automatically generates filenames using the `yyyyMMdd_HHmmss` format to ensure files are sorted by date and time in your storage folder.
* **Custom Appends:** Optionally add a specific project or "session" name to the end of the timestamped filename for easier identification later.

### Prompts Breakdown
1.  **Script Logic Type:** Select `[D]etailed` or `[S]ingle Line`.
2.  **Export Decision:** Choose `[Y]es`, `[N]o`, or `[E]xit`.
3.  **Export Format:** Choose `[C]sv`, `[T]xt`, or `[B]oth`.
4.  **Export Directory:** Enter the target save location (e.g., a OneDrive or Project folder).
5.  **Custom Name:** Toggle `[Y]` or `[N]` to append a custom name to the timestamp.

## 📂 Script 2: Explorer Path Importer
The Importer script reads the data generated by the Exporter and re-opens the directories as tabs.

### Key Features
* **Directory Scanning:** Point the script at your export folder, and it dynamically lists all available files with selection numbers.
* **File Filtering:** Filter the file list by `[C]sv`, `[T]xt`, or `[A]ll` to find your session backup quickly.
* **Tabbed Opening:** Specifically optimized for Windows 11 to group opened folders into a single window using tabs.
* **Selective Restoration (Grid View):** Choose to open the entire list or launch a graphical selection window to pick specific folders.

### The "Grid View" Selector
When choosing to **[P]ick specific folders**, the script launches a Windows "Out-GridView" pop-up:
* **Filter:** Use the search bar at the top of the pop-up to find specific paths.
* **Multi-Select:** Hold `Ctrl` or `Shift` to highlight multiple folders.
* **Execute:** Click **OK** in the bottom-right corner to open only the highlighted paths.

## 🎨 UI & Design Standard
Both scripts follow a standardized "Toolbox" design pattern developed for clarity and ease of use:

1.  **Context Header:** A cyan-colored header identifying the script version.
2.  **Purpose Block:** A yellow-colored manual explaining the script's goal and a roadmap of the prompts you are about to encounter.
3.  **The Pause/Clear Choice:** A secondary prompt asking: *"Do you want to clear script terminal before running this script?"* * This acts as a deliberate pause to allow the user to read the instructions before the screen wipes and the work begins.

## 📋 Requirements & Setup
* **OS:** Windows 10 or Windows 11 (Note: Folder Tabbing is a Windows 11 exclusive feature).
* **PowerShell Version:** 5.1 or 7+.
* **File Extension:** Ensure scripts are saved with the `.ps1` extension.

### Installation
1.  Save the Exporter code as `Explorer_Exporter.ps1`.
2.  Save the Importer code as `Explorer_Importer.ps1`.
3.  Ensure your PowerShell Execution Policy allows local scripts to run (run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` if needed).

## ⚠️ Important Notes
* **Windows 11 Tabs:** To ensure folders open in tabs rather than separate windows, the script includes a 900ms delay. If folders still open in new windows, ensure **"Open each folder in its own window"** is **unchecked** in your File Explorer Folder Options.
* **OneDrive Integration:** By exporting to a OneDrive-synced folder, you can use these scripts to "sync" your open workspace across different physical computers.
